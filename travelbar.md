The SkySavvy TravelBar allows you to perform flight searches, airport and airline lookups, and other travel-related queries directly from your browser's search bar (the Chrome "Omnibox").

To get started, simply type `ss` (for "SkySavvy") in the URL bar. You'll see the "SkySavvy" prefix added. Then type a space and begin your query. See below for options:

* `ss [airport]` - Example: `ss jfk` - Search for an airport by its IATA code. Returns the airport name and location.
* `ss [airline]` - Example: `ss ua` - Search for an airline by its IATA code. Returns the airline name, details, alliance, and transfer partners.
* `ss [flight number` - Example: `ss ua108` - Search for a flight number. Returns direct links to FlightAware and FlightStats.
* `ss [airport] [airport` - Example: `ss jfk hnl` - Trigger a new Google Flights search for the given origin and destination.
* `ss help` - Open this page.
